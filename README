####### Requirements #######

- QEMU
- brctl command line tool (can be found in distro packages like
  bridge-utils)
- QEMU VM image with the IRATI stack installed in


####### Instructions - please follow the specified order ########

(1) Run ./configure script to set the IRATI installation path on the VM,
    the path of the QEMU VM image on the host file system and the
    login username on the VM

(2) Copy template.conf in /etc/template.conf on the VM

(3) Copy enroll.py to /usr/bin (or other $PATH element) on the VM

(4) Compile mac2ifname.c into mac2ifname and copy it to /usr/bin
    (or other $PATH element) on the VM

(5) Specify the desired topology in gen.conf

(6) Run ./gen.py

(7) Use ./up.sh to bootstrap the scenario

(8) VMs are accessible at localhost ports 2223, 2224, 2225, etc.
	e.g. ssh -p2223 ${username}@localhost

(9) Perform your tests on the VMs using ssh

(10) Shutdown the scenario (destroying the VMs) using ./down.sh

(11) VMs launched by ./up.sh have a non-persistent disk --> modifications
     will be lost at shutdown time (10).
     To make persistent modifications to the VM image (e.g. to update PRISTINE
     software), run ./program.sh and access the VM at
          ssh -p2222 ${username}@localhost
